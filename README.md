## Assignment-1
Arterial spin labeling (ASL), also known as arterial spin tagging, is a magnetic resonance imaging technique used to quantify cerebral blood perfusion by labelling blood water as it flows throughout the brain. ASL specifically refers to magnetic labeling of arterial blood below the imaging slab, without the need of gadolinium contrast,[1] which is the first of its kind in terms of perfusion imaging. A number of ASL schemes are possible, the simplest being flow alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) which requires two acquisitions of identical parameters with the exception of the out-of-slice saturation; the difference in the two images is theoretically only from inflowing spins, and may be considered a 'perfusion map'.[2] The technique was developed by John Detre, Alan P. Koretsky and coworkers in 1992.
